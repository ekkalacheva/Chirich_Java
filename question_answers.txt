The bracket sequence [((())()(())]] cannot be considered correct. 

The number of opening round brackets "(" is 6, which is greater than the number of closing round brackets ")", which is 5. 
The number of opening square brackets "[" is 1, which does not match the number of closing square brackets "]", which is 2.

To fix these issues, the number of opening brackets of each type must correspond to the number of closing brackets of that type. 
Additionally, the opening bracket must always come before its corresponding closing bracket.

For example, to correct this sequence, the redundant closing square bracket should be removed and the missing closing round bracket should be added: [((())()(()))].
